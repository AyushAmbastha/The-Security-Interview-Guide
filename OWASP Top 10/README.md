# OWASP Top 10

The Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) is a non-profit foundation dedicated to improving 
the security of software.

OWASP Top 10 is an online document that provides ranking of and remediation guidance for the top 10 
most critical web application security risks. Every 2-3 years the list is updated in accordance with 
advancements and changes in the AppSec market. 

The list is important because it gives organizations a way to prioritize risks and focus on the ones 
that are more prevalent in the community. OWASP takes data from various organizations regarding their 
applications and the vulnerabilities found in them to make this list "the largest and most comprehensive 
application security data set".

The risks are ordered according to <ins>prevalence, detectability, impact and exploitability.</ins>

Note: The most recent version was released in 2021 and that's what we are going to be discussing today.
