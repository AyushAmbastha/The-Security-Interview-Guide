# Vulnerable and Outdated Components

## Description

If you do not scan for vulnerabilities or do not fix/upgrade components in a timely fashion, you are likely vulnerable to this. Other examples of a situation in which you are likely impacted by this is if you do not know the versions of all components you use, if software is vulnerable, unsupported, or out of date, if you do not test the compatibility of updated, upgraded, or patched libraries.

## Prevention

A patch management system to -
1. Remove unused dependencies, unnecessary features, components, files, and documentation.
2. Continuously inventory the versions of the software used in both client and server side. 
3. Monitor for libraries and components that are unmaintained or do not create security patches for older versions.
