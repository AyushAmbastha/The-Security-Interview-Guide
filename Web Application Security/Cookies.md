# Cookies

### What are cookies?

Cookies are usually small text files, given ID tags that are stored on your computer's browser directory or program data subfolders. They are created when you use your browser to visit a website that uses cookies to keep track of your movements within the site, help you resume where you left off, remember your registered login, theme selection, preferences, and other customization functions.

Cookie files are automatically lodged into the memory of your browser and each one typically contains:
1. The name of the server the cookie was sent from
2. The lifetime of the cookie
3. A value - usually a randomly generated unique number

The website server which sent the cookie uses this number to recognise you when you return to a site or browse from page to page. Only the server that sent a cookie can read, and therefore use, that cookie.

There are broadly two kinds of cookies - 
1. Session Cookies - Session cookies are created temporarily in your browser's subfolder while you are visiting a website. Once you leave the site, the session cookie is deleted.
2. Persistent Cookies - Persistent cookies remain in your browser's subfolder and are activated again once you visit the website that created that particular cookie. A persistent cookie remains in the browser's subfolder for the duration period set within the cookie's file.  
    Persistent Cookies are used for two primary purposes -  
    1. Authentication. These cookies track whether a user is logged in and under what name. They also streamline login information, so users don't have to remember site passwords.  
    2. Tracking. These cookies track multiple visits to the same site over time. Some online merchants, for example, use cookies to track visits from particular users, including the pages and products viewed. The information they gain allows them to suggest other items that might interest visitors. Gradually, a profile is built based on a user's browsing history on that site.

Intended uses of a cookie -
1. Session Management
2. Personalization
3. Tracking

Web developers also get to free up storage space on the website's servers. Since the cookies stores on the user's browser has all the personalization settings, the website can simply look them up and apply them once you visit.

### How can cookies be used against you?

1. Cookie Profiling - Websites create cookies automatically when a user lands on a page online. Whether it is a permanent or a temporary cookie, the idea is to create a “log” of the user to facilitate future visits to the said site. When these cookies are collected to create a certain idea (profile) about a user, that is called cookie profiling, or web profiling. This can be used maliciously, for instance, stalking on certain individuals in order to victimize them.
