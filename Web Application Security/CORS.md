# Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)

With CORS, browsers have a work-around in order to get data from servers. It is an HTTP-header based mechanism that allows a server to indicate any origins (domain, scheme, or port) other than its own from which a browser should permit loading of resources. CORS also relies on a mechanism by which browsers make a "preflight" request to the server hosting the cross-origin resource, in order to check that the server will permit the actual request. In that preflight, the browser sends headers that indicate the HTTP method and headers that will be used in the actual request. After the servers review the headers, the server will either accept the request and comply or reject the request and decline.

It extends and adds flexibility to the same-origin policy (SOP). However, it also provides potential for cross-domain based attacks, if a website's CORS policy is poorly configured and implemented. CORS is not a protection against cross-origin attacks such as cross-site request forgery (CSRF).
