### How would you analyze a suspicious email link?

1. Check for "Warning Flags" in the Email  
    1. No legitimate organisation will send emails from an address that ends ‘@gmail.com’ OR The domain name is misspelt ex. bankoamerica.com
    2. Spelling/grammatical errors in the body text of the email
    3. Long, alphabetical lists or nothing in the "To:" field 
    4. Vague "Subject" line
    5. Missing salutation ("Hello", "Good afternoon", etc.)
    6. Sense of urgency (i.e., "This link will expire in 24 hours")

2. Check links for legitimacy  
    1. Hover over any suspicious links, don't click it, and the destination of the link will pop up. 
    If the destination is different from the one mentioned in the email, it's a big red flag.
    2. Use websites like virustotal.com that scans URLs and uploaded files with different scanners and gives you a detailed report.

3. Check phone numbers for legitimacy  
    Sometimes, phishing emails contain a phone number to make the email seem real. Websites like whitepages.com can help you find additional information regarding the phone number. Any strange/unexpected location is a red flag.
